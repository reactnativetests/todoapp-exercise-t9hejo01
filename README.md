Create basic To-do list application with React Native.

Task Instructions

1. App setup
   - Create single screen component called ToDoScreen and make this screen initial view.

2. Adding new tasks
   - Add TextInput field for typing new task in.
   - Add button labeled "Add" next to the input.
   - When pressing Add button:
       -  Entered task should be added to list with a timestamp in YYYY.mm.dd format and
          the input field should clear itself after adding.
       -  Tasks should be stored in the component's state as an array.

4. Displaying the task list
     - Display a list of tasks below the input field using a scrollable FlatList.
     - Each tasks item should display the task text clearly.
